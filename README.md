# UWOC
Underwater Wireless Optical Communications Simulation Tool

This code is the modified version of the "PHOTONATOR" simulation tool by William Cox 
(which is avaiable at http://www.github.com/gallamine/Photonator 
or  https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.16/7588. )

This code is a Monte Carlo simulation tool to model the laser beam propagation through underwater channel with both absorption and turbidity.
